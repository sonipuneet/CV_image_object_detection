# Image Object Detection using Feature Matching and Template Matching

Goal - To identify objects of different categories within an image and differentitate between them based on their categories using the <b>heuristic approach</b> (Instead of machine learning approach).

Usage:

First install the opencv python bindings with

$ pip install opencv-python

Then run the script in your jupyter notebook:

Feature Matching : <b><i>feature_matching_test.ipynb</i></b>

The script will attempt to match the feature of query image in the input image.

Total Execution time for feature matching of an image is <b>0.0567</b> seconds

Application Of Feature Detection And Matching:

<ol>
	<li>Image retrieval and indexing</li>
	<li>Recognition</li>
	<li>Automate object tracking</li>
    <li>Point matching for computing disparity</li>
    <li>Stereo calibration(Estimation of the fundamental matrix)</li>
    <li>Motion-based segmentation</li>
    <li>3D object reconstruction</li>
    <li>Robot navigation</li>
</ol>
